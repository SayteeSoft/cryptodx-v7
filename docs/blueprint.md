# **App Name**: NextPlate

## Core Features:

- Project Initialization: Scaffold a new Next.js project with a basic file structure and configuration, including a layout component.
- Intelligent Configuration: The LLM 'tool' decides on an appropriate tech stack (e.g., Typescript, Tailwind) and includes best-practice configurations (ESLint, Prettier) based on user input.
- AI-Powered Content Generation: Generate a basic landing page or sample component with placeholder content and a pre-designed UI using AI.
- Automated Setup: Automated creation of necessary environment variable files (.env.local) and package.json setup with relevant dependencies and scripts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#2BCDC1) to evoke a sense of innovation and freshness in web development. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), nearly desaturated teal, to ensure content readability.
- Accent color: Soft turquoise (#41E2D4) for secondary actions, subtly drawing the user's attention.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, lending a techy feel; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a neutral, modern aesthetic.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying configuration files, environment variables etc.
- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent different aspects of the project scaffolding (e.g., settings, components, styles).
- Implement a clean and structured layout, using grid and flexbox, to present generated project details clearly and accessibly.
