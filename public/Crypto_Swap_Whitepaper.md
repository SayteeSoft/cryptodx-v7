## Chapter 2: Core Platform Features

### 2.1. Decentralized Swapping

The heart of Crypto Swap is its robust, non-custodial token swapping interface. Users can trade a wide array of cryptocurrencies directly from their personal wallets.

*   **Real-Time Price Feeds:** Integration with the CoinMarketCap API ensures users see up-to-the-minute prices.
*   **Customizable Transactions:** Users can configure transaction settings, including slippage tolerance and deadlines, for precise control over their trades.
*   **Order Types:** The platform supports market swaps, limit orders, and interfaces for buying and selling crypto with fiat currencies.

### 2.2. Multi-Chain Support

Crypto Swap is designed with a multi-chain future in mind. The interface allows users to select from major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, providing a centralized hub for cross-ecosystem activities.

### 2.3. Wallet Connectivity

We support a wide range of popular Web3 wallets through standard protocols.

*   **Direct Integration:** Seamless connection with browser extension wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.
*   **Security:** The platform never has access to user private keys or funds. All transactions are signed and authorized by the user in their own wallet.

### 2.4. Comprehensive Market Data

The "Explore" section offers a rich data environment for market research.

*   **Token Explorer:** A detailed, filterable, and searchable list of hundreds of tokens with key metrics.

## Chapter 3: AI-Powered Enhancements

Crypto Swap differentiates itself through the strategic integration of Google's Gemini models via the Genkit framework.

### 3.1. AI-Driven Reputation Alerts

A unique security feature that proactively scans tokens for a history of scams, scandals, or other major negative events.

*   **Functionality:** When a user attempts to swap, buy, or sell a token, the AI analyst reviews public data.
*   **User Notification:** If a significant risk is detected, a clear, actionable alert is presented to the user, including a summary of the issue and a source link.
*   **Premium Feature:** For Advanced and Administrator users, these alerts are read aloud in the user's selected site language.

### 3.2. Intelligent Chatbot Assistant

An AI-powered chatbot is available to assist users with questions about blockchain, DeFi, crypto, NFTs, and AI.

*   **Context-Aware:** The chatbot can access real-time token information from the platform and provide direct links to relevant pages.
*   **Multilingual Support:** For premium users (Advanced and Administrator), the chatbot can converse fluently in dozens of languages, with both text and audio responses, independent of the main site's language setting.
*   **Tiered Access:** The Free plan offers English-only text responses, while the Basic plan supports multilingual text.

### 3.3. Slippage Simulation

An educational tool that helps users understand the concept of price slippage. Users can adjust parameters like trade size and simulated pool liquidity to see how price impact and expected output change in real-time.

### 3.4. Live Market Alerts

A background AI agent continuously scans for significant, time-sensitive events in the Web3 and AI space, delivering important news and security alerts directly to the user via non-intrusive toast notifications.
